# README

This is my portfolio app where I'll be adding all my projects. I am really bad at front-end so, this will we a back-end focused project. There might even be some pages with literally no css but I'll try my best to improve everything as much as I can.

# Goals of This Project

- I'll be creating my own website using Ruby on Rails.
- I'll try to write clean code following the Rubocop Style Guide.
- I'll use a lot of OOP.
- I'll get better at Design Patterns.
- I'll get better at Databases (especially PostgreSQL).
- I'll get better at Front-end Development.

# How to Test

I will start writing RSpec tests really soon but for now, you can test manually.

# How to Contribute

I am open to any kind of improvements so, even the slightest of helps will be well appreciated. It would be even better if it's on the front-end side :)
